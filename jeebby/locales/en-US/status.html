Read the value(s) of the selected sensor(s). There are 4 ways to read values: last value, since a specific ID, since last date or last days.

### Inputs
: payload (string | integer) : can be used in the actions.

### Outputs
For every selected sensor there is an output.

1. Sensor N
: payload (object | array) : contains the value, sensor name and ID.

2. Error
: payload (object | string) : contains the error message or error response from Axios.
: error (object) : the complete error response object from Axios.

### Details
This node fetches the values of the selected sensor(s).
Every sensor has it's own output port. This is designed so you can use one sensor node and perform different actions with each sensor value(s).

The `msg.payload` contains an object `{value: ..., crodeonId: ..., datetime: ...}`.
* The value is the value of the sensor.
* The crodeonId is de ID send of the Crodeon record holding this sensor value.
* Datetime is the datetime in UTC timezone.

#### Last value
`msg.payload` contains an object and is the last value of the sensor.

#### Since ID
`msg.payload` contains an array of sensor result objects since a given Crodeon ID.
You can inject the Crodeon ID with a `msg` property and set this in the configuration of this node.

#### Last days
`msg.payload` contains an array of sensor result objects for the last given days.
You can inject the amount of last days with a `msg` property and set this in the configuration of this node.

#### Since date
`msg.payload` contains an array of sensor result objects since a given ISO-8601 date.
You can inject the date with a `msg` property and set this in the configuration of this node.

#### Node status
* green : everything is OK.
* orange : node is busy with the request.
* red : an error occurred.
